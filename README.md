# Smooth-IDR
Extension of Isotonic Distributional Regression (https://github.com/AlexanderHenzi/isodistrreg) to its kernel-smoothed version, which yields a smooth and consistent estimator of the conditional CDF under the assumption of stochastic monotonicity. This also provides a consistent estimator of the conditional density, with two bw selection approaches.
